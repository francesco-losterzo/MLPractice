# ML Practice

This repo is for getting my hands dirty with ML stuff. Any suggestion/contribution/whatever is more than welcome!
It contains three folders:
- Notes: contains notes and summary of discussions about the different ML topics
- Notebooks: contains jupyter notebooks with solutions to exercise/problems
- data: contains the data used in the exercises

The main sources used are:
- the [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) course
- the ["Neural Network and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) book
